Jan-2019: Moved from Yahoo Weather to OpenWeatherMap.

Since Yahoo Weather dropped support for API v1 and now a key is needed I change to OpenWeatherMap.

This service also need key but is very easy to get one.

- Yahoo weather (not working): .conkyrc-LEGACY 
- OpenWeatherMap (check resolutions): .conkyrc-XXX
